* captions along ways (open polygons) not supported yet
* border width of closed polygons seams to have a bug.
* Negative OSM IDs may colide, read_osm() does not assign IDs properly.
* Bug refine_poly() if lat[0] == lat[1]
* signal handling in threaded mode does not work (sigprocmask)
* free objects sometimes segfaults in threaded mode
