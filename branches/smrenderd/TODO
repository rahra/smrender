* captions along ways (open polygons) not supported yet
* border width of closed polygons seams to have a bug. (already fixed?)
* Negative OSM IDs may colide, read_osm() does not assign IDs properly. (low prio)
* Bug refine_poly() if lat[0] == lat[1]
* free objects sometimes segfaults in threaded mode
* multi-line text output
* incomplete() several rules, one filename (like out())
* automatic bay/cape font size
* color diff function improvement (black/white stretching in spherical coordinate system)
* missing safety check for latitudes > 85.05
* segfault if library of external function in ruleset could not be loaded
